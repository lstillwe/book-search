## Description
This repository contains a Google book search web application. This application was created from the starter code found [HERE](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli). It was a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and it has been refactored it to use the GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The web application was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It is set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
